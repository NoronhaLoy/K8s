1. Kubernetes Services Overview
Purpose: Kubernetes services are crucial for exposing applications within a cluster or to the outside world.
Functionality: They provide a stable IP address and DNS name to access applications, enabling easy scaling and load balancing.
Role in Cluster: Services facilitate communication between different components within the cluster and with external clients.
2. Introduction to Kubernetes Ingress
Definition: Kubernetes Ingress is a resource that manages external access to services within a Kubernetes cluster.
Functionality: It operates as a bridge between Kubernetes services and the external world.
Capabilities:
Load Balancing: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend services.
SSL Termination: Handles SSL/TLS termination, securing communication.
Routing: Directs traffic based on rules defined by the user, such as path-based or host-based routing.
3. Differences Between Ingress and Services
Service Exposure: While services expose applications at a cluster or external level, Ingress is specifically designed to manage external access with advanced features.
API Object: Ingress is not a service type but a distinct API object in Kubernetes, separate from Service types like ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer.
4. Advanced Access Control with Ingress
Granular Control: Ingress allows for detailed control over how and who can access the services within a cluster.
External Exposure: It simplifies exposing services to the internet while providing mechanisms to secure and manage access.
This structure highlights the role of Kubernetes Ingress in managing and securing access to services within a Kubernetes cluster, distinguishing it from traditional service exposure methods.
