K8s Services:
    What Problems Do Kubernetes Services Solve?
In Kubernetes, Pods are non-permanent resources - they can appear and disappear as needed. This is because Kubernetes constantly checks to make sure the cluster is running the desired number of replicas (copies) of your app. And Pods are created or destroyed to match this desired state.

Think of it this way: if you need more replicas of your app because of an increase in incoming traffic (more demand), Kubernetes will spin up some new Pods to handle it. If a Pod fails for some reason, no worries - Kubernetes will quickly create a new one to replace it. And if you want to update your app, Kubernetes can destroy old Pods and create new ones with the updated code. So the set of Pods running at one moment could be totally different from the set running a moment later.

But here's the thing - if you want to access your app, how do you keep track of which Pod to connect to with all these changing IP addresses of Pods?

That's where Services come in. They provide an unchanging location for a group of Pods. So even though the Pods themselves are dynamic, the Services make sure you always have a central location to access your app.

Now that we understand one purpose of Kubernetes Services, letâ€™s take a closer look at the different types of available Services.
